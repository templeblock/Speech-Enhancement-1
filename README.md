Single channel speech dereverberation
========

In this study, we propose such a preprocessing technique for combined detection and enhancement of reverberant speech using a single microphone for distant speech applications. The proposed system employs a framework where the target speech is synthesized using continuous auditory masks estimated from sub-band signals. 

Linear gammatone analysis/synthesis filter banks are used as an auditory model for sub-band processing. Features for each of these sub- band signals are extracted from short-time frames which are shifted in time. An apt consolidation of these extracted features are used in estimating the probability of a frame comprising sourceâ€™s direct path, which is later used as a continuous auditory mask to preserve & retrieve the direct path from the rever- berant signal. The speech activity is determined by clustering frames with high probability. The sub-band signals with an au- ditory mask applied are passed through a set of synthesis filters to reconstruct enhanced speech signal.
